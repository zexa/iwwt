Interview Task for Wise Team by Augustinas Kalvis.

## Notes
Besides simply displaying my skills I used the chance to play around with some 
technologies, such as PicoCSS for styling frontend. PicoCSS is a css framework
that prides itself in avoiding classes as much as possible by levaraging 
semantic html. Figured it would be more than enough for a small CRUD app.

I went with twig for since I figured this would be fairly straight forward 
although I should've went with react to display my skills as well as facilitate
dynamic rendering. Instead, I was stuck writing basic js to handle
searches, book rendering, etc.

Book editing and deletion is accessed when the user is logged in.

## Initialization

docker compose up
symfony server:start
